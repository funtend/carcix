## `@funtend/carcix`

This is a concise module designed for handling CAR files, currently supporting CAR v0 and Node.js + Bun only. Initially developed for individual usage, it may be rewritten in the future to provide complete functionality. This module is built on the foundations of [ipfs-car](https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car), [@ipld/dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-cbor) and [@ipld/car](https://github.com/ipld/js-car).
